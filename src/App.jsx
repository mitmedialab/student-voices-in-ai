            The Student Voices in AI program empowers students to lead
            conversations about how AI should be used in their schools. Over 12
            weeks, students build confidence in navigating AI in their school
            lives, engage their community to understand local perspectives, and
            propose school guidelines or policies. Through a mix of projects,
            activities, and conversations, the club fosters community dialogue
            and helps teens develop a thoughtful approach to using AI in school.
